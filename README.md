# Base p5 directotry
## Bayley King - king2b3@mail.uc.edu


### Files
- `sketch.js` the "main" file which is run. draw() and setup() are located here.
- All P5 related materials are in the `libraries/` directory. 
- `index.html` points to the P5 libraries as well as `sketch.js`. Any added files need to be referenced here.

### Server
Currently utilizing built in VSC local server through the "Live Server" extension.

Take a look at https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server to install other server methods. I will eventually add a python based local server, but VSC is good enough for now. 

### Other Notes
This directory will serve as the base directory for all P5 related works I complete. 
It will be perioidcally updated with QOL changes as I learn more about JS and P5 as a whole.

### Goals
My goals with this "project" is to refine my programming skills, and build some sample programs showcasing various CS topics like EC, algorithms, graphics, structures, etc.

### TODO
- Move libraries into another base folder.
- - With this new file structure, each folder doesn't need the P5 library. 
- -  Update the base folder to match this new structure.
- Create bash or shell to run python web server
- - Test on Ubuntu and Windows
